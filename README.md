# Bash-scripts
A collection of random one off bash scripts that are probably only useful to me. Typically they are for web application hacking and recon when using Termux on a phone.

1)form_finder.sh:
Looks for forms and inputs in a supplied list of URLs and outputs the URLs to pages that DO contain forms/inputs.

2)endpoints.sh:
Finds endpoints in websites. Can target one site or a use 'mass mode' to first enumerate subdomains then scan all of them. Requires Tomnomnom's 'assetfinder' and 'httprobe'.
