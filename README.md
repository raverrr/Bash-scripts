# Bash-scripts
A collection of random one off bash scripts that are probably only useful to me. Typically they are for web application havking and recon when using Termux on a phone.

1)form_finder.sh:
Looks for forms and inputs in a supplied list of URLs and outputs the URLs to pages that DO contain forms/inputs.
